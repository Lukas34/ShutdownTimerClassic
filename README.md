I also have an UWP based version of this project which will be available on the Microsoft Store when its ready. But that will take some time. Once the project is ready I will update this document and my website.

# Usage
Shutdown Timer is a very simple application hence it is easy to use.
Just choose a power action (method) from the drop-down menu and then dial in the time span you want. If the counter reaches zero the choosen power action will be executed.
